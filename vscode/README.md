# VS Code Server Home Assistant add-on

This add-on packages the Microsoft VS Code Server (via
[`ahmadnassri/vscode-server`](https://github.com/ahmadnassri/docker-vscode-server))
inside the Home Assistant add-on base image so you can use the official VS Code
marketplace, GitHub Copilot, and Copilot Chat from the Home Assistant frontend.

## Ports and ingress

- Internal port: `8000`
- Home Assistant ingress is enabled by default.
- You can optionally expose `8000/tcp` for direct access when running outside of
ingress.

## Building locally

To build the add-on image manually:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg BUILD_FROM=ghcr.io/hassio-addons/debian-base:9.1.0 \
  --build-arg VSCODE_SERVER_TAG=latest \
  -t local/vscode-server-ha \
  vscode
```

Replace `BUILD_FROM` with the Home Assistant base image for your architecture
and, if desired, pin `VSCODE_SERVER_TAG` to a specific VS Code Server release.
